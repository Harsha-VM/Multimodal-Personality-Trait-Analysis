# Multimodal-Personality-Trait-Analysis
Multimodal Fusion for Precision Personality Trait Analysis: A Comprehensive Model Integrating Video, Audio, and Text Inputs

Created a comprehensive multimodal model that analyzes individuals' personality traits, encompassing the Big Five traits : Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. By employing BERT for text classification, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients with CNN for audio analysis, and Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing, the system holistically examines the correlation between personality characteristics, speech, body language, and facial expressions. It facilitates self-discovery and personal growth for individuals and aids employers in the effective matching of candidates to suitable job positions based on their personality traits, providing better job satisfaction, productivity, enhanced workplace dynamics and overall societal well-being.
